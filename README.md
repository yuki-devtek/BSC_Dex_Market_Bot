## BSC-Dex-Maket-Making-Bot

This is a trading bot that manages the price of the WAGMI token deployed on Bsc at address (https://bscscan.com/token/0x1e987df68cc13d271e621ec82e050a1bbd62c180. 
And also on Ethereum at address (https://etherscan.io/token/0x1e987df68cc13d271e621ec82e050a1bbd62c180). 


The bot works by continuously scanning the prices of the two tokens (one on bsc and the other on ethereum) to ensure that the price is almost the same.
The bot makes use of a smart contract that performs the logic to maintain the token price and a node js application for continuous monitoring of the token prices.
